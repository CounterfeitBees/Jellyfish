				<strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter-Bold; ">0. Abstract</span></strong>
			</p>
			<p style="widows:0; orphans:0">
				<span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter">The purpose of this study was to answer the question: Teachers commonly use two methods to impart information in classrooms. The first is </span><u><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter; ">explaining</span></u><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter"> (lecturing, leading discussions, answering questions, etc.) the second is </span><u><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter; ">questioning</span></u><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter"> (asking students to try it themselves, ask questions, share what they think, etc.). What are the effects of these two approaches on retention of information? What is their effect on accuracy of students information? What is their effect on each other?</span>
			</p>
			<p style="widows:0; orphans:0">
				<span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter">&#xa0;</span>
			</p>
			<p style="widows:0; orphans:0">
				<span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter">However, due to my inability to use technology, the study only tracked the impact of questions on retention, and because people were immediately given a survey (full of questions) in both the control and questioning condition it’s unclear if my study would’ve been capable of detecting any effect even if there is an effect. This study has significant flaws that prevent it from providing usable data to respond to its hypothesis.</span>

				<span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter">The first is a very successful digital lesson. There was almost no difference between people’s average scores on the initial skill assessment (average score 3.86/5) and on the skill assessment they took two weeks later (average score 4.00/5). And most people tested highly with relatively low levels of serious misconceptions. </span>

				<span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter">The second is results that suggest a relationship between</span><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter">&#xa0; </span><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter">one’s employment and enrollment status (full time, part time while being in college, or just being in college) and retention of information. Full-time workers scored the highest on the followup assessment, followed by students, followed by part time workers who were also students (who scored significantly lower). However I do not trust my very low sample size. MORE SCIENCE IS NEEDED!</span>

When selecting only participants who said they knew “almost nothing” or “some” about the RGB color (count = 22) theory this score becomes 4.00 (45% misconception).</span>

					This was already discussed, but this study supports the idea of mental load, that there’s limits to how much humans can be doing or learning at a time.

					A complete dissection of this study could be incredibly fun. Turning it into a “digital lesson” and breaking it down into various parts that could be removed or tuned up or down could provide insight to the teaching and learning process within a lesson framework. It is also very much in the spirit of the original design for the study.   Furthermore, I suspect this could be paradigm generating or strengthening for specific teaching strategies. It could lead to insights into what makes a good class or lesson.

I don’t know why this is! (maybe personality?)  There was also a person who went from “255?” to “256?” when taking the followup. So maybe this has to do with </span><strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter-Bold; font-size:12pt; ">doubt</span></strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter; font-size:12pt"> or </span><strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter-Bold; font-size:12pt; ">unsureness in one’s answer </span></strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter; font-size:12pt">and not with misconception strengthening (or maybe these things are one and the same). Maybe doubt leads to a strengthened misconception. Maybe if you iterate doubt on a mind it destroys true conceptions and strengthens misconceptions with each step. Example in table below: </span>

					 Iteration 2 of idea 3 is where doubt gets tricky. Does doubt lead to “RBG color theory can be used for paint?” (adding doubt to the misconception) or does doubt lead to “RGB color theory can <strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter-Bold; ">definitely</span></strong> be used for paint” adding further doubt between the misconception and the truth. Unclear. I suspect the former is true but I want the latter to be true…

					A participant who claimed to have “a fair amount” of knowledge in the RGB color theory scored a 2/5 on the first test with a seeming misconception, however they scored a 5/5 on the second test with no misconception. I wonder if this gets at an idea of “activation.” When they had just taken the survey their mind was “activated” and therefore they were attempting to express and think about ideas beyond the scope of the question, whereas, when they were taking the followup survey they were not activated in the same way.*

					One person’s response to the question “how do you make yellow with RGB sliders?” was “Move the red and green sliders to a positive value and have the blue sliders set to zero” in the first one and “you would turn the red and green sliders all the way up and the blue slider all the way down” in the second one. This is more accurate. There was also a person who said that the primary colors were “red green and cyan” in the first answer, and “red green and blue” in the second. In the first answer they also said that “green and cyan?” made yellow but in the second answer they said “I don’t remember.”  I’m not sure what this means but I’ve wanted to do research into mindsets and the power of “I don’t know” and “I don’t remember” as mindsets for a while. I suspect this has some overlap with the Zen idea of Beginner Mind.

					One person described the RGB color theory as “RGB color theory is how colors are mixed to display other colors. It is based on the idea that the three primary colors of <strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter-Bold; ">red yellow and blue</span></strong> can be mixed to create not just six, but all the other colors in the visual spectrum. It is not enough to just mix the colors because the amount of light can also effect how the colors are viewed.” And then preceded to answer every question wrong in the first survey. When they got the second survey they said “RBG color theory is the idea that all colors can be displayed with a combination of magenta, cyan and yellow.&#xa0; By mixing these colors in different proportions/saturation you can create all the other colors available for digital displays.” And got all but one question correct? Including the question of primary colors? What is going on? I am baffled by this response! They also said they did not research the RGB color at all! <strong><span style="font-family:AmericanTypewriter-Bold; ">This is wild!</span></strong>

  <p>In <a href="carStoryTwo.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">this photo</a> I am barefoot on top of a car. There are other cars driving past. We have a donut and a tire iron, but the jack that we have is fucked and rusted beyond opening. I have a sign, attempting to flag down a car. I am hysterically laughing at the hillarity of this situation and as a result I am crying. As tears roll down my face I hold a sign that says "help ned jack" desperately at oncoming cars, every car moves into the left lane to avoid me. Alena says "There is something very political about this sign." I say "If ever there was a time to start smoking, surely it would be now."</p>

	<h1>Get That Guy Information</h1>
	<p>Get that guy is a game where there will be guys who need to be got. They will run, they will hide, if technology is on our side they will be live streaming their location to you. Get them for a TBD Prize.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The game takes place mostly outside for the duration of an hour so dress for the weather, bring a waterbottle, and bring a team of freinds or lovers (or fly solo as a cool loner). Get that guy.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p><b>Date:</b> Dec/14th/2024 at 2:00pm</p>
	<p><b>Location:</b> FPH Main Lecture Hall / Whole Campus</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>If you have any accessability concerns, would like to be an NPC, or if you have a bald cap contact Violet <a href="mma22@hampshire.edu">mma22@hampshire.edu</a></p>
	<p>.</p>
	<p><b>RULES</b></p>
	<p>There will be 5+ guys running around campus. If you tag them you can walk them to FPH to win a point. However, if you are tagged by a member of another team you have to sit down until all  members of other teams are gone or also sitting down (and then you count to 15 before getting up again). If another team tags your guy they can walk him to FPH instead of you, so <i>be careful</i> and <i>be sneaky</i>. You are welcome to play for the whole hour to hour and a half, show up just for the opening ceremonies, or drop in at any time! Get that guy is about having fun with freinds, strangers, and, of course, guys in suits and (maybe) baldcaps.</p>

    <h2>This is a bunch of things I read or heard (or said) and then wrote down <i>because I liked them.</i></h2>
    <p><i>There are at least two kinds of games, one could be described as finite and the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing play.</i> - Finite and Infinite Games, James P. Carse</p>
    <p><i>When discussing plants, which do not have a brain, other terms are usually used: acclimatization, priming, hardingin, conditioning, all of them linguistic acrobatics coined over the years by scientists to avoid the comfortable and simple use of the word 'memory.'</i> - The Revolutionary Genius of Plants, Stephano Mancuso </p>
    <p><i>Naive Ontological Realism</i> - Ethan Ludwin-Peery
    <br>An ontology is how you look at the world. For example, looking at a door and knowing you can go through it requires an ontology. The ontology is "doors can be opened and closed and I can walk through them." But it also carries some other related ontologies such as "windows are not for entering buildings" or "buildings are to be entered through walls, not ceilings." 
    <br>Ontological Realism is the belief that there is one <i>true</i>, <i>real</i>, or <i>correct</i> ontology. It tends to come with the acompanying belief that everyone should know <i>the</i> ontology and often creates discomfort in induviduals who must watch the people who do not have <i>the</i> truth. 
    <br>Naive Ontological Realism is when one doesn't even know that you don't have to be an Ontological Realist. Naive Ontological Realists aren't open to changing thier minds about what is true real or correct because they do not beleive or understand how that could be done.</p>
    <p><i>The things to look out for in your systems are zeros and infinities.</i> - Joshua A.C. Newman</p>
    <p><i>For whom does the sky burn? <br>For whom does the blood run?<br>...<br>To whom does the freak accident occur?<br>To you (oh my god, oh my god)<br>...</i><br>- For You, Dylan Kanner</p>
    <p><i>You're very good at seeing the options laid out in front of you... like, in life.</i> - Ema Govea <br><i>I feel quite stuck on this website not working right now though...</i> - me</p>
    <p><i>Do you remember when you said 'Do you want to learn spanish or do you want to know it? Becuase there's a difference between wanting to know something and wanting to work hard and learn it.'?</i> - Skyler DuPont<br><i>No, but I remember that I was trying to talk about </i> - me</p>

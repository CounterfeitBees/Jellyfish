  <p><i>There are at least two kinds of games, one could be described as finite and the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game is played for the purpose of continuing play.</i>

  <p>...</p>

  <p><i>What one wins in a finite game is a title. A title is the acknowledgment of others that one has been the winner of a particular game. 

  <p>Titles are public. They are for others to notice. I expect others to address me according to my titles, but I do not address myself with them-unless, of course, I address myself as an other. The effectiveness of a title depends on its visibility, its noticeability, to others.</i> 

  <p>...</p>

  <p><i>The titled are powerful. Those around them are expected to yield, to withdraw their opposition, and to conform to their will-in the arena in which the title was won...<p>Power is always measured in units of comparison. In fact, it is a term of competition: How much resistance can I over- come relative to others?</i>

  <p>...</p>

  <p><i>We need a term that will stand in contrast to "power" as it acquires its meaning in finite play. Let us say that where the finite player plays to be powerful the infinite player plays with strength. 
  <p>A powerful person is one who brings the past to an outcome, settling all its unresolved issues. A strong person is one who carries the past into the future, showing that none of its issues is capable of resolution. Power is concerned with what has already happened; strength with what has yet to happen. Power is finite in amount. Strength cannot be measured, be- cause it is an opening and not a closing act. Power refers to the freedom persons have within limits, strength to the free- dom persons have with limits. 
  <p>Power will always be restricted to a relatively small number of selected persons. Anyone can be strong. 
  <p>Strength is paradoxical. I am not strong because I can force others to do what I wish as a result of my play with them, but because I can allow them to do what they wish in the course of my play with them.</i> <p>- Finite and Infinite Games, James P. Carse</p>

  <p><i>When discussing plants, which do not have a brain, other terms are usually used: acclimatization, priming, hardening, conditioning, all of them linguistic acrobatics coined over the years by scientists to avoid the comfortable and simple use of the word 'memory.'</i> - The Revolutionary Genius of Plants, Stephano Mancuso </p>

  <p><i>Naive Ontological Realism</i> - Ethan Ludwin-Peery
  <p style="margin-left: 25px;">
    An ontology is how you look at the world. You could see a car as a hunk of metal or a vehical for transportaion. How you look at the car depends on your ontology, therefore your ontology causes you to interact with the world differently; a hunk of metal can be scrapped, a vehical can be driven across the country while drinking only boxed wine and eating only peanut butter.
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Ontological Realism is the belief that there is one <i>true</i>, <i>real</i>, or <i>correct</i> ontology. It tends to come with the acompanying belief that everyone should know <i>the</i> ontology and often creates discomfort in ontological realists who feel that they must watch the people who do not have <i>the</i> ontology. An ontological realist might look at someone driving a car across the country and sigh thinking 'they don't know cars are metal to be scraped.' Meanwhile, the ontological realist driving the car might look at the junkyard she passes and think 'why are all these cars standing still? They are to be driven!'
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Naivity is unawareness of other options. For example, a monkey trapped in a square room for its whole life would be naive to the fact that rooms could be other shapes, or that anything outside of its square room exists.
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Therefore, Naive Ontological Realism is when one is an ontological realist who doesn't know that there is anything other than ontological realism. 
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">In a debate an ontological realist might say "cars are to be drivin not scrapped!" In responce another ontological realist might say "cars are to be scrapped not driven!" The monkey-himself a naive ontological realist-would cry and think "I don't understand what they're talking about! Cars are a square box I've lived in for my whole life."
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Naive ontological realists aren't open to changing their minds becuase they do not believe other ontologies exist, and even if you convinced them that other ontologies exist they wouldn't be able to understand them.
    <p style="margin-left: 25px;">Ontological realism can be contrasted with ontological relitivism. Ontological reletivism believes that ontologies are not used because they contain an ineffable truth quality (like ontological realism beleives) but rather because they are useful. For example, when you are homeless a car is a good sleeping spot, when you have a home a car is a shit sleeping spot. You choose the ontology that is useful depending on your context.

  <p><i>...Experience is realistic, not abstract. Psychical life is the fullest, deepest, and richest manifestation of this experience. The New Psychology is content to get its logic from this experience, and not do violence to the sanctity and integrity of the latter by forcing it to conform to certain preconceived abstract ideas. It wants the logic of fact, of process, of life. It has within its departments of knowledge no psycho-statics, for it can nowhere find spiritual life at rest. For this reason, it abandons all legal fiction of logical and mathematical analogies and rules; and is willing to throw itself upon experience, believing that the mother which has borne it will not betray it. But it makes no attempts to dictate to this experience, and tell it what it must be in order to square with a scholastic logic. Thus the New Psychology bears the realistic stamp of contact with life.
  <p>From this general characteristic result most of its features. It has already been noticed that it insists upon the unity and solidarity of psychical life against abstract theories which would break it up into atomic elements or independent powers. It lays large stress upon the will; not as an abstract power of unmotivated choice, nor as an executive power to obey the behests of the understanding, the legislative branch of the psychical government, but as a living bond connecting and conditioning all mental activity. It emphasizes the teleological element, not in any mechanical or external sense, but regarding life as an organism in which immanent ideas or purposes are realizing themselves through the development of experience. Thus modern psychology is intensely ethical in its tendencies. As it refuses to hypostatize abstractions into self-subsistent individuals, and as it insists upon the automatic spontaneous elements in man's life, it is making possible for the first time an adequate psychology of man's religious nature and experience...</i> - The New Psychology, John Dewey | link: <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dewey/newpsych.htm">http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dewey/newpsych.htm</a></p>

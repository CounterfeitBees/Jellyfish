Steps to apply for FOOD STAMPS otherwise known as SNAP or AN EBT CARD

1. ARE YOU ELIGIBLE?
	If you HAVE FEDERAL WORK STUDY, and you have A JOB THAT PAYS YOU THROUGH WORK STUDY (usually this is an on-campus job but sometimes organizations like the Yiddish Book Center can pay you through federal work study), and ARE LIVING IN A MOD then YOU ARE ELIGIBLE!

2. HOW TO APPLY
	The best place to reach out to is the Food Bank of Western Mass: (413) 992-6204, the specific person who frequently works with Hampshire students is Megan Schuck (megans@foodbankwma.org). However there are alternate organizations to reach out to.
	One such organization is the DTA: Call the DTA Assistance Line at 877-382-2363 or go to https://www.mass.gov/guides/how-to-contact-dta to learn more. You can also find them through this site: https://www.mass.gov/how-to/apply-for-snap-benefits-food-stamps although it may be more cumbersome.

3. BONUS COOL THINGS
	The River Valley Co-Op has 10% off for people who use EBT and often have free produce: https://rivervalley.coop/community/food-for-all
	The Massachusetts Health Incentives Program (HIP) allows you to use your EBT for produce and get a refund (which can double up to $40 of EBT). https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-healthy-incentives-program-hip-frequently-asked-questions
	Brookfield Farm, which is just off of Bay Rd a few miles East of campus, has CSA offerings when Hampshire's farm does not, and they are set up to accept EBT and fall under the HIP. During their open seasons, both Amherst and Belchertown's Farmer's Markets are set up for HIP, at least as far as I have found.

1. Growth

For most of my life I couldn't learn violin; now I still don't know violin but I can learn.


2. Time

Violet: “What if I called you sometimes in the evening and we read together?”

Lilith: “Well that’s the problem. I’d always say no.”
        “When we started talking about time I said I was too busy to do anything.”

Violet: “Well surely the solution is not to add another thing to schedule.”

Lilith: “I just realized that.”

Violet: “Me too.”


3. Robot

I used to be a robot. Now I have a flip-phone and don't wear shoes.

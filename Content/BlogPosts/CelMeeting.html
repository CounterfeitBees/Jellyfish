				<span style="font-family:Times New Roman">Near the end of Fall Semester of 2023 I sent out a survey to all students at Hampshire. Over the course of a week while living with miserable lesbians in a beautiful part of California I wrote up the results of the survey into a document that I emailed to two members of faculty who I thought might want to have a role in it.</span>

I was flabbergasted by this and they were unphased by the results of my survey (and given this comment by Vivica Greene potentially didn’t read them*). They agreed that “What students say they will do (or would do hypothetically) tends to differ from what they will do.” With Vivica going on to bring up that “Students love the idea of there being no attendance policy for classes, but they tend to feel crappy about themselves and their courses if they don't go b/c it's almost always easier not to go to something than it is to go. Most of us benefit from having a reason to go other than ‘I feel like it.’”</span>

Laura is just kind of old and sad and it’s a bummer that she’s an education professor who can’t teach a class that doesn’t make her students miserable, and Vivica is an insane woman who shit-talks the students here to faculty and occasionally to other students. The best thing we can do is refuse them as our advisors and teachers. Boycott their classes, tell first years to do the same, and drop them as advisors if at all possible. Then we can try and restructure the hiring process so that it is student led with administrative support. This way there is no faculty politics where some faculty are in charge of hiring others because we’re in charge of hiring them!</span>

Sheila, being the amazing woman she is, set up a meeting with herself, me, Javiera Benavente, and Gary Hawkins (who I didn’t realize was the dean of faculty until 10 minutes before the meeting).
